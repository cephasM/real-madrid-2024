# ⚽ Real Madrid Data Science Project – Season 2024

Welcome to my Data Science project focused on analyzing **Real Madrid's squad and team structure** for the 2024 season. This project combines **Python** for web scraping and data preprocessing with **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how data science techniques can be applied to football analytics. From raw data collection through web scraping to data transformation and interactive visualizations, this project walks through the full pipeline of a real-world sports analytics case.
